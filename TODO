Ideas about additions for git-bz
================================

The presence of an idea here does not necessarily imply that I have
any intention of working on it myself.

Allow omitting bug reference when obvious

 When there is only one commit, and -u/--add-url has previously been used,
 or the commit subject/body contains [Bb]ug #?\d+ you should be able do just:

   git bz attach HEAD^

Default to -e/--edit when only one commit

 When there is only one commit to attach, we might as well default to
 -e/--edit - it's more powerful than the prompt and still allows aborting.

Automatically guess obvious obsoletes

 When doing attach -e/--edit, and there is an existing patch who's description
 matches the Subject of the attachment, start the Obsoletes line
 uncommented?

Use XML-RPC when available.

  Maybe use python-bugzilla: http://fedorahosted.org/python-bugzilla/

  Not sure there are a lot of advantages to this; one thing that it
  might be possible to do with this is allow the user to specify only
  the product and get an interactive list of components. Also, better
  error handling.

Handle redirects:

  Should follow redirects, both to different URLs and http => https

Better display of errors

  Currently specifying a non-existent product/component just dumps
  out raw HTML for the reply. Etc.

More general patch application

  'git bz apply' currently only handles patches formated with
  'git format-patch', it should be able to apply general patches
  as well. For general patches, you would use information from
  bugzilla to prime the author and commit message, but allow
  further editing of the commit message.

Make -u/--add-url kinder on the reflog

  -u works by resetting, then on each patch, running git cherry-pick
  followed by git commit --amend. It would be nice to only have one
  (informative) reflog entry for the entire process, or at least avoid
  the double commits.
